# Microsoft ToDo CLI App

This command line interface tool is for interacting with your account in Microsoft's To Do [application](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/)

To be able to start using it you would have to:

1. Configure your personal API key in MS' site, as described [here](https://github.com/kiblee/tod0/blob/master/GET_KEY.md)

2. Set credentials generated in (1) as values in your [config
   file](https://github.com/betasve/mstd/blob/master/.mstd.yml.example),
   (namely) `client_id` and `client_secret`

3. Start using it e.g. `mstd --help` (`mstd` is the work-in progress name for
   the compiled tool, but you can name it and use it as you wish
